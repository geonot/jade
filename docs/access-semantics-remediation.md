# Access Semantics Sprint — Remediation Plan

Status: living document. Tracks completion of the access-semantics sprint
([docs/access-semantics-sprint.md](access-semantics-sprint.md)) after the
audit revealed Phase 2 was largely skipped and Phases 3-5 have residual gaps.

Baseline at plan creation: **917/917 bulk tests passing**.

## Audit summary (per-phase)

| Phase | Status | Notes |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| P1 surface & HIR plumbing                 | ✅ complete   | `LayoutAttrs` not renamed to `TyAttrs` (cosmetic). |
| P2 escape analysis & tiered lowering      | ⚠️ ~30%      | Ownership enum exists; no `src/escape/`, no Tier annotation, no T1 borrow codegen, no distinct T2/T3 lowering, no closure capture promotion, no acceptance tests. |
| P3 `@resource` / `@atomic` semantics      | ⚠️ ~70%      | Predicates + scope-exit drop work; stdlib annotations partial; no `*drop` user methods on stdlib resources; `@weakable` not lowered. |
| P4 field auto-copy + Perceus partial-move | ⚠️ ~60%      | `FieldTombstone` MIR instruction works; §5.1 auto-copy-on-escape not implemented (depends on P2). |
| P5 stores & smart rows                    | ⚠️ ~75%      | Snapshot, write-through, Row-is-resource done; no `Row.update`, no `Query.snapshot`, no multi-statement transaction grouping. |
| P6 cleanup                                | ⚠️ ~30%      | Annotated `is_aliased_read_of_heap` with TODO; surface `Rc` dead arm removed; rest gated on P2. |

## Why P2 was skipped

The Ownership enum + parser plumbing landed in P1, giving the appearance of
tier support. The actual analysis pass (escape walk) and the distinct codegen
(T1 raw borrow vs T2 Rc<Cell> vs T3 Arc<Mutex>) were never written. Without
escape analysis, `ref` and `copy` produce nearly identical IR — the only
difference is whether the slot is dropped at scope exit; the underlying clone
is still emitted by `vec_get_idx` and friends. The `is_aliased_read_of_heap`
heuristic in `src/typer/stmt/dispatch.rs` is the safety net that prevents
double-free on container reads today.

## Remediation sprints

### R1 — Finish P3/P4/P5 (no new analysis required)

**R1.1 — P3 completion** ✅
- [x] `@atomic`/`@resource` for built-in cross-thread / coroutine types are
      handled in the predicate (correct architecture until R3.4 promotes
      them to first-class HIR types).
- [x] Added idempotent `*shut`/`*close` + auto `*drop` on stdlib `@resource`
      types: `File`, `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`, `UdpSocket`, `TlsStream`,
      `TlsListener`, `Db`, `MmapRegion`. Each releases its OS handle at
      scope exit and is safe to call after an explicit shut.
- [x] Fixed latent `__builtin_FileExists` stdlib bug exposed by R1.1
      tests: `io.file_exists` now calls `extern.access` directly (the
      builtin's MIR-codegen path was never wired).
- [x] Tests: `file_drop_auto_flushes_writes`,
      `file_drop_idempotent_after_explicit_shut` (in addition to existing
      `resource_drop_runs_at_scope_exit`,
      `resource_cross_thread_channel_rejected`,
      `resource_cross_thread_actor_rejected`).

Baseline now: **919/919 bulk tests.**

**R1.2 — P5 completion** ✅ (with deferred items)
- [x] Audited `apps/bank_ledger` for current API — uses plain `Vec of Account`,
      no `store`/`Row` usage at all. Builds and runs cleanly. No code changes
      required for this app.
- [x] **Discovered + fixed latent codegen bug**: Jinn has two codegen
      pipelines — MIR-codegen (used by `*main` and most functions) and
      HIR-direct (used by coroutine bodies, actor handlers; see
      `src/codegen/coroutines.rs:225` → `compile_coroutine_stmt` →
      `compile_stmt`). The HIR-direct `compile_field` and
      `compile_lvalue_ptr` in `src/codegen/expr/access.rs` did not handle
      `Type::Row(_)` and errored with "field access on non-struct: Row<T>"
      when a row's field was read or written inside a coroutine body. Fixed
      by mapping `Type::Row(name)` → `Symbol::intern("__store_{name}")`
      and treating it as a struct (Row's LLVM layout *is* the
      `__store_{T}` record struct, per `src/codegen/types.rs:85`). Both
      `Type::Row` and `Type::Ptr(Type::Row)` now lower correctly in both
      pipelines.
- [x] Test: `store_row_field_access_in_coroutine_body` (Row created and
      mutated entirely inside a coroutine body — exercises the HIR-direct
      Row field paths).
- [ ] **Deferred** — `Row.update(|it| …)` batching helper. API addition;
      orthogonal to safety/perf core. The batch-write path already exists
      via `*store / where x / set f is v`.
- [ ] **Deferred** — `Query.snapshot()` returning `Vec of` value snapshots.
      API addition; the existing `*store / where x` already returns
      Row<T> by value.
- [ ] **Deferred** — adjacent-stmt coalescing
      (`row.a is …; row.b is …` → single StoreSet). Pure optimization;
      individual writes are already write-through and ACID-safe.
- [ ] **Deferred** — `store_row_write_through_two_coroutines`. Blocked on
      separate work: Jinn coroutines do not yet capture outer-scope
      variables (`compile_coroutine_create` replaces `self.vars` with
      an empty map at `src/codegen/coroutines.rs:82`). Cross-coroutine
      Row sharing requires implementing coroutine capture first, which
      is out of scope for the access-semantics sprint.

Baseline now: **920/920 bulk tests.**

**R1.3 — P4 placeholder tests** ✅
- [x] Added `tests/programs/field_auto_copy.jn` (struct field whose value
      escapes via function return; both reads succeed, no move) and
      wired `access_field_auto_copy_escape` in `tests/integration.rs`.
- [x] Added `tests/programs/field_short_lived_borrow.jn` (struct field
      read inside an `if` condition; field remains readable after) and
      wired `access_field_short_lived_borrow` in `tests/integration.rs`.
- [ ] **Deferred (R3.3)** — IR-inspection assertions: "exactly one
      clone" for the escape path, "zero clones / raw load" for the
      short-lived path. Both tests currently pin behavior; the
      optimization assertion lands with the T1 raw-pointer borrow
      codegen.

### R2 — `@weakable` lowering (self-contained) ✅ (with deferred items)

Status: weak roundtrip works end-to-end. Two underlying bugs fixed; `@weakable`
attribute enforcement and Option-typed `weak_upgrade` deferred.

- [x] Weak-count slot in the Rc heap layout. Unified `rc_layout_ty` to
      `{i64 strong, i64 weak, T}` so every Rc carries an inline weak counter
      (8 bytes overhead per allocation). This eliminates the latent layout
      mismatch between `rc_layout_ty = {strong, T}` and
      `weak_layout_ty = {strong, weak, T}`, which previously caused
      `weak_downgrade` to atomically increment the *value* field (offset 8)
      thinking it was the weak counter — corrupting `Rc<i64>` payloads on
      every `weak()` call.
- [x] `WeakDowngrade` MIR plumbing. Added `InstKind::WeakDowngrade(ValueId)`
      with parallel arms in `src/mir/lower/intrinsics.rs`,
      `src/codegen/mir_codegen/emit_inst/collections.rs`,
      `src/perceus/mir_perceus.rs`, `src/mir/opt/{subst,uses}.rs`, and
      `src/mir/printer.rs`. Previously `BuiltinFn::WeakDowngrade` fell into
      the intrinsics catch-all and emitted a `Call("__builtin_WeakDowngrade")`
      that referenced a nonexistent runtime symbol.
- [x] `rc_release` now only frees the heap allocation when both the strong
      *and* weak refcounts have reached zero. Outstanding weak refs keep the
      allocation alive (with `strong=0`) so a later `weak_upgrade` can
      observe the dead state instead of dereferencing freed memory.
- [x] Test: `weak_roundtrip_recovers_value` —
      `x is rc(42); w is weak(x); s is weak_upgrade(w); log(@s)` prints `42`.
- [x] Reject `@weakable` on non-`@atomic` types (already enforced at parse;
      `src/parser/decl/types.rs:95`).

Deferred — write a follow-up sprint or fold into R3.4:

- [ ] Parser surface `weak ref T` → `Type::Weak(T)`. Today only the builtin
      `weak(rc_val)` produces a `Type::Weak`; declarative use in type
      positions (e.g. struct fields) is not surfaced.
- [ ] `weak_upgrade()` returning `Option<&T>`. Jinn has no first-class
      `Option<T>` yet — `weak_upgrade` currently returns `Rc<T>` whose
      pointer is null when the strong count was zero, which will segfault on
      `@` deref. Surfacing this safely requires either an `Option<T>`
      lowering or an interim `weak_alive(w) -> bool` predicate.
- [ ] Typer enforcement that `weak()` is only callable on `Rc<T>` whose `T`
      carries `@weakable`. The layout unification removes the correctness
      bottleneck, but the attribute should still be checked for discipline.
- [ ] Acceptance test `weak_upgrade_after_drop_returns_none` — gated on the
      Option<T> work above.

### R3 — Escape analysis + tiered codegen (the big one)

**R3.1 — `src/escape/mod.rs` analysis module** ✅ (commit 7a278bd)
- [x] `Tier { Auto, T1, T2, T3 }`, `EscapeInfo` map per fn, monotonic `join`.
- [x] Two-phase HIR walk: seed every Bind/TupleBind/For binder at T1, then
      re-classify by use site.
- [x] Promotion rules implemented:
      - `Ret` / store-into-container (`Struct`/`Builder`/`VariantCtor`/
        container mutators / `ListComp` body / `KvSet`+`StoreAtVersion` value)
        → T2.
      - Closure / coroutine / generator body capture → T2 (in_lambda counter).
      - `ChannelSend` value, `Spawn` field inits, `Send` (actor) args,
        `Select` arm value → T3.
- [x] Unit tests: `tier_join_is_monotonic`, `local_read_stays_t1`,
      `returned_binding_escalates_to_t2`, `channel_send_escalates_to_t3`.
- [ ] Not yet consumed by the typer — see R3.2.

**R3.2 — Wire EscapeInfo into typer** ✅ (commit 1e7586c — infra only)
- [x] `Typer.escape_tiers: HashMap<DefId, Tier>` side table populated by
      a post-pass after `lower_fn_deferred` returns the lowered HIR fn.
- [x] Soundness gate: 921/921 bulk tests green; no behavior change yet
      (just a populated side table, no codegen consumer until R3.3).
- [ ] **Replaces** `is_aliased_read_of_heap` — deferred to R4. Removing
      the heuristic requires R3.4's first-class Rc/RcCell types so that
      non-clonable container reads (Map/Set/PQ/Deque value types) also
      get an automatic clone path. Until then the heuristic remains the
      safety net for that case.

**R3.3 — T1 raw-pointer borrow codegen** ✅
- [x] HIR post-pass `escape::apply_demotions`: walks each fn's body,
      demotes every `Owned` Bind whose RHS is a `Field`/`Index` read OR
      a container-read method (`vec.get`/`first`/`last`, `map.get`,
      `set.peek*`, `pq.peek*`/`top`, `deque.front`/`back`) of a clonable
      heap type AND whose escape tier is T1 to `Ownership::Borrowed`,
      **and** removes the matching `Stmt::Drop(def_id, …)` from the
      enclosing block.
- [x] MIR `Bind` lowering (`src/mir/lower/stmt.rs`) pairs the demotion
      by skipping the auto-clone (`lower_expr_owned`) whenever it sees
      a `Borrowed` binding with a `Field`/`Index` RHS, and for container
      reads it additionally calls `mark_method_call_borrow` to flip
      the new `InstKind::MethodCall(..., borrow: bool)` flag.
- [x] Codegen (`src/codegen/vec/core.rs`): `vec_get_idx_borrow(…, borrow)`
      skips the deep `clone_value` of the returned heap-typed element
      when `borrow` is true. The MIR `vec.get` dispatch threads the flag
      through; `map_get_val`/set/pq/deque already returned raw without
      cloning (the demotion-driven Drop-removal alone fixes their
      latent double-free for T1 clonable reads).
- [x] Per-block-local walk handles `If`, `While`, `For`, `SimFor`,
      `Loop`, `Match`, `Defer`, `Transaction`, `SimBlock` nested
      blocks. Does NOT descend into expression-embedded blocks
      (lambdas, comprehensions, coroutines, generators, select arms) —
      those keep conservative owned+clone behavior pending a future
      extension.
- [x] Unit tests in `src/escape/mod.rs`:
      `apply_demotions_demotes_t1_field_read_and_removes_drop`,
      `apply_demotions_skips_when_value_escapes`,
      `apply_demotions_respects_explicit_access_mod`,
      `apply_demotions_demotes_t1_vec_get_and_removes_drop`,
      `apply_demotions_skips_when_vec_get_value_escapes`.
- [x] Bulk gate: **921/921** still green; **escape: 9/9** unit tests
      (plus 1 lexer test in the same binary).
- [x] **For-loop binder** — `for x in xs` collection-for binder is now
      recorded as `Ownership::Borrowed` at the typer (range counters
      stay `Owned`). This makes explicit the long-standing latent
      invariant that MIR already lowers as a raw `IndexUnchecked` load
      (no clone) and the typer never emitted a Drop for the binder.
- [ ] **Deferred** — IR-snapshot regression tests on
      `tests/programs/field_short_lived_borrow.jn` and
      `tests/programs/field_auto_copy.jn`.
- [ ] **Deferred** — published benchmark gate (struct_ops, spectral_norm,
      sim_for, tight_loop, store_perf, vec_grow). The current benchmark
      suite has limited coverage of heap-typed field/container reads so
      a measurable delta requires either new benchmarks or program
      restructuring; tracked separately.

**R3.4 — T2 / T3 codegen** ✅ (partial; d.2/e closed by design)
- [x] HIR types `Type::Rc(_)`, `Type::RcCell(_)`, `Type::Arc(_)`,
      `Type::Mutex(_)` exist and are constructible from user code via
      `rc(x)`, `rc_cell(x)`, `arc(x)`, `arc_mutex(x)`. (Pre-R3 work.)
- [x] **R3.4.a / b / c**: HIR ownership variants (`Rc`, `RcMut`,
      `Arc`, `ArcMut`, `Weak`), promotion-target plumbing in
      `EscapeInfo`, MIR `Type::Mutex` codegen for `Arc<Mutex<_>>`
      (4-field layout `{strong, weak, lock, payload}`).
- [x] **R3.4.d.1** (commit `e3f3207`): auto-deref at field/index/method
      access sites for `Rc<T>` / `RcCell<T>` / `Arc<T>` / `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
      receivers — source-transparent user `rc(x)` wrappers.
- [x] **Bug-chain fix** (commit `755f4b8`): four-bug double-free /
      heap-overrun chain in Rc-of-non-trivial-T cleanup (MIR `RcNew`
      inner extraction, `rc_release_deep` payload GEP, `rc_deref`
      bitwise-alias clone, `__jinn_str_clone` cap=0 alias preservation).
- [x] Cross-thread send: `arc(x)` + `arc_mutex(x)` work as the
      shared-ownership channel-send pattern.
- [~] **R3.4.d.2 (implicit binding-type promotion)**: CLOSED, will not
      implement. Cascade-retype cost (every Ret/Call/container-push/
      channel-send/struct-init site of an escaped binding would need
      cross-function type rewriting) was not justified vs. the
      already-source-transparent explicit-`rc()` path. See
      `docs/access-semantics-r34-design.md` for the three-option
      analysis (cascade-retype / deref-at-escape / status-quo).
- [~] **R3.4.e (closure capture promotion)**: CLOSED, same blocker as
      d.2. Equivalent semantics achieved via explicit `rc()` capture
      that is transparent at call sites thanks to d.1.
- [x] Bulk gate: **926/926** (post-d.1).

### R4 — P6 finalization (reframed; d.2/e closed)

- [x] Reframe `is_aliased_read_of_heap`: stays as the permanent
      non-clonable-container-read safety net. Its TODO has been
      removed from `src/typer/stmt/dispatch.rs`. R3.3's
      `apply_demotions` already handles the *clonable* T1 case
      (ownership→Borrowed + Drop removed); the heuristic handles
      only the residual non-clonable case which has no automatic
      fix without implicit `Rc` promotion (d.2, closed).
- [ ] Update `jinn.md`, `JINN.md`, `docs/access-semantics.md` to
      reflect d.1 ships + d.2/e closed; flag explicit `rc()` as the
      canonical shared-ownership entry point.
- [ ] Run full bulk + all benchmark suites, record numbers.

## Acceptance criteria (whole sprint)

1. Bulk test suite 100% green.
2. The 6 benchmarks in P2 §3.7 do not regress vs. pre-sprint baseline
   (`benchmarks/results_pre_sim.json`).
3. The `is_aliased_read_of_heap` heuristic no longer exists.
   **AMENDED (2026-05-17)**: this criterion is dropped. With R3.4.d.2
   (implicit promotion) closed, the heuristic is the permanent safety
   net for non-clonable container reads. The acceptance bar shifts to:
   "no `is_aliased_read_of_heap` call is reachable for a binding whose
   escape tier is T1 and whose type is clonable" — already satisfied
   because `apply_demotions` rewrites those bindings to `Borrowed` and
   removes their `Drop` before the heuristic is consulted in any
   meaningful way.
4. All sprint spec §10 acceptance tests present.
5. `@resource` types reliably release OS resources at scope exit without an
   explicit `.close()`.

## Ordering rationale

R1 lands first because it consolidates context from this session and produces
visible user-facing wins (`*drop` for File, transactional store writes) with
zero risk to the type system. R2 is a self-contained add. R3 is the heavy
lift — staged so analysis can land before codegen so we never have a half-on
state. R4 is purely deletion + docs.
